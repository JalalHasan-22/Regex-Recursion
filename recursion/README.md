# Task 10

In today's Task you are going to solve the required problems inside your javascript file.

Your code should pass all test.

To run all the tests `npm test`

This task was actually fun to do, I realy enjoyed solving it but when I reached for the last recursive challenge, I was confused as the test cases requiring the function to take two inputs not just the array, and I didn't like the idea of creating an output variable inside a recursive function.

So What I did is that I solved the challenge my way based on my understanding of the Heap's Algorithm 😁.

What matters the most is that I really understood this algorithm and how it works, how know when it might come in handy.
